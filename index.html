                <p>We are a collection of acoustic singer-songwriters in Saigon. We love performing, hearing new artists and organising shows. We put on weekly open mic nights and jam sessions to bring musicians from across the city together, as well as organising monthly showcases of local artists. Here you can share your own events with people who are passionate about live music, and we will professionally promote any and all events you send us for free. We're here to support all local musicians bring their music to the public and we hope to see you soon!</p>
